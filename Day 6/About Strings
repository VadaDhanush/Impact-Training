STRINGS:-

-> Collection of charecters.

-> As all the elements are similar that is y we created an array to store all those similar elememnts, and to get array values using index values
Similarly to store multiple charecters we created a string.

-> When u created a string reference will be stored in stack memory, object will be created in string pool. Once a object is created in string pool it will be created with some fixed size so we cant remove we cant add we cant modify the string that is y "strings are immutable".

                            "HELLO"             " "
                             "ELLO"             "H"
                             "LLO"              "H"
                              "LO"              "HL"
                              "O"               "HLL"
                                                "HLLO" 

-> Whenever input string becomes empty we have to stop the recursion.
