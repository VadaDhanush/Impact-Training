DATA STRUCTURE AND ALGORITHM:-

* DATA STRUCTURES :- DS are the ways to organize and store data so it can be accessed and modified efficiently.

             Ex:- Stack, Queue, Linked list, Graph, Tree, Array

* ALGORITHMS :- These are step by step procedures for solving problems. They often work with data structures.

            Ex:- Dynamic, Back tracking, Greedy, Sorting, Searching

* TIME COMPLEXITY :-
1. Ignore constants.
2. Ignore small values.
3. Focus on worst case.

* SPACE COMPLEXITY :-
-> The extra space we are using to solve problem.
-> Use cases :- Browsers, Google maps

/// Type of DATAT STRUCTURE :-
** Linear and non linear
-> LINEAR :- Linked list, Stack and Queue.
-> NON-LINEAR :- Trees, Graphs, Heaps.
