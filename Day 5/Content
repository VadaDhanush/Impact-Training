// Greedy Algorithm:-

-->  Custom Sorting:- If it is sorting we have only 2 possibilities , either ascending or descending & when it comes to custom sorting we can sort the values according to our format 

                                Ex:- 19,26,37 ----> 37,26,19     
                                      Ascend        Descend            26,37,19 ---> Custom Sorting

-> From given arrays make pairs 
-> Sort the array based on end type 
-> After sorting for sure will take 1st meeting 
-> Compare end time to starting time of next pair
-> If starting time is strictly greater consider the meeting

RECURSIONS:-
-> Recursions are nothing but it and its self
// Two Types
-> Function calling same function it self and it self 
-> Function calling another function it self and it self 

-> If we didn't mention base case properly will get an exception called stack overflow.
-> Recursions are used to break the code.
