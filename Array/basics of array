*ARRAY*:-

int a=1;
int a=2;
int a=3;
-> All the reference names will be stored in stack memory
-> All the values which were assigned to those variables will be stored in heap memory

Q1) Here all the blocks are having same data type. If all the blocks having b same data type, Y to create multiple variables, simply we can create an array to store all those values.

// Def of Array:- Collection of similar type of data in a continuos allocation.
-> If variable A stored at address 100, then the second value of the array should be allocated at 104.

// SYNTAX OF ARRAY:-
datatype[] array name;

class main{
public static void main(String[] args) {
int[] arr = {1,2,3,4,5};
int[] arr;
arr = {1,2,3,4,5};
  }
}

-> If u want to get the data previously we store all the data values in the individual variables
-> If u want the data simply we can print the variables & in array we have to print the data using index values.
-> Index values by default it will start with "0".


-> To get the size of array, we have to use "arr.length".
-> To get the length of string "str.length".

TYPE SOF OUT FORMATS:-
1. We can use simple for loop.
2. Using for each loop.
3. 

-> tostring is an inbuilt method to print array values.
-> internally tostring contains for loop and it will print along with open and closed square brackets followed by commas.
-> Java strictly follows camel case.


// Initializing and declaring th array with size
   int[] arr = new int[5];
-> Once you created an array along with size it cant be modified the size is fixed.

   int[] arr, will be created in stack memory and call it as a reference and new key word helps to create object space for the array.

-> If the array type is integer by default all the values will be zero & if array type is string then all the default will be NULL.


-> Whenever we r trying to assign or print nth index we will get array out of bound exception

// PREMETIVE DATA TYPES:- This are cant be splitted or divided.
  Ex:- int, float, char.

// NON-PREMETIVE DATA TYPES:- This can be splitted or divided.
  Ex:- strings and all user defined objects.
