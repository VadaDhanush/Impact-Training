 /// MAJORITY ELEMENTS:-

-> Find the majority of an element in a given array

-> Assume that strating elemenr is my target element
-> Whenever counter becomes zero restart the target value very next element of the array.
-> If counter becomes zero it states that there is no majority elements and counter>0 check that target element in our array and 
   count how many times it repeated and if it is repeated more than n/2 thats the majority element

[2,2,1,2,1] -> [2 (element > n/2)] 

/// LONGEST CONSECUTIVE ELEMENTS:-
  -> [1,2,101,3,102,4,103]      ->     [4 (1,2,3,4)]
                                       [3 (101,102,103)]
/// STEPS
-> Push the array elements in to the set, as set doesnt contains index values
-> Start elements iterating using for each loop.
-> Find the starting point.
