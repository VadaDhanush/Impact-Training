-> Array element should be consecutive. 
-> Elements might be continous .

/// Substring :- Characters should be continuous
/// Sub sequence :- Characters might be continuous or might not be. It should be sequence, reverse not possible.

/// SLIDING WINDOW :-
-> Input :- abcabcdb
-> Step 1 :- Initialize L & R pointer at 0th index.
-> Run the loop from R to n-1 . Create a set
-> Check R characters in set, if we dont have push the character into the set. After pushing the character increase R.
-> If R character contains in the set remove L character and move L pointer.
-> Calculate the length. Formula:- "R-L+1".
